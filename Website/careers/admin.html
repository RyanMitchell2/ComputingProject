    <h2>Job Information</h2>
    <p>Administration is the process or activity of running a business or organisation, including the management of people,
	funds or other factors that influence a business or even a Government, such as public affairs and opinion.
	Jobs that are under the category of Administration require efficient planning, organisation and coordination in 
	directing and controlling over material and human resourcs to get the best results that incur the least material costs.
	Management is one of, if not the most important aspects of a business or organisation. This expands the scope of this
	field to various jobs over different sectors, from the public sector such as Civil Service and Government to the private sector
	with Human Resources, Sales Administrator and even supervising. Administration is an extremely good skill to have in all jobs that require
	plannings and documentation or any bureacratic activity. This makes Administration a well sought and flexible career path, that you may wish
	to take.</p>
