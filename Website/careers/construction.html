    <h2>Job Information</h2>
    <p>Construction is a fundamental job category for our modern society, it's what builds our houses, roads, bridges and every piece of infastructure in the UK and the world. It is a ever developing
	trade that, with the development of new technologies, it is becoming much easier for workers. However, this makes Construction at risk of being replaced by automation, although only time will tell.
	Right now, however, Construction is a popular trade that many people can enter with few qualifactions whilst also allowing you to advance in the industry. There are also has more advanced aspects
	of the trade; Land Surveyors and Architects require a high amount of organisation and planning to effectively and efficiently build and maintain safe infastructure and buildings.</p>
