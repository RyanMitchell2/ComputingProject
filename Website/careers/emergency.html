    <h2>Job Information</h2>
    <p>Emergency Services have a major role in our society and are the main force that keep the law and people safe. The jobs under this category have various different roles. Police roles help protect
	people from and prevent crimes, as well as keep the peace. Paramedics, Hospital workers and Doctors help save lives and keep people healthy. Paramedics are first responders that deal with stabilising
	and delivering patients to hospital. Doctors, in a hospital setting, perform surgeries as well as diagnose patients and Hospital workers have the highly important role of
	supporting doctors and making sure the hospital keeps running efficiently. Fire service workers help put out fires, as well as save people from rubble and crashed cars.</p>
	<p>Emergency Services can be a danagerous, but noble profession that normally isn't that high paid, considering the danger one would have to face. However, those up to the challenge, or a sense of
	duty to the public, or those to wish to help people, may find themselves taking a liking to this job category. These are also professions where one can hope to advance and be promoted, bringing in more
	money and responsibility.</p>
